# Shoe store exercise

## Getting Started

Run the [Shoe Store](https://github.com/fassousa/Shoe-Websocket-Server).

This app is using **ruby version 3.0.0**, **rails version 7.0.3** and **sqlite3 version 1.4**

Create the database and run the rails server.

Endpoints:

```
api/v1/stores
api/v1/inventory
api/v1/alerts
```
To start fetching data from the [Shoe Store](https://github.com/fassousa/Shoe-Websocket-Server) hit the 'inventory' endpoint.

There is also a little test suit for the stores_controller.

## Goal

**Design an interface that would allow the inventory department to monitor Aldo's stores and shoes inventory.**

Hope you’ll have fun with this little test. I know I had designing it.
Go wild. It can be anything you want. I’ve seen results printed to console, displayed on a webpage, and even someone who did periodical database dumps.

Here are a few ideas if you need an extra challenge:

- Add some sort of alerting system, e.g. When a shoe model at a store goes too low, or too high.
- Add a REST JSON API, or GraphQL
- Suggest shoe transfers from one store to another according to inventory
- Your own crazy idea!
